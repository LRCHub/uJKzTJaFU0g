I'll never know what it was like
Not to have a man
To raise these children on your own
Without a single plan
God I know that you were crazy
But I loved the way your raised me

Got a brother in the ground
Still feel him around
Got a bottle for a dad
Peace he never had
Got a way to live my life
Got a way to feel myself
Got a way to live my life

I'll never know what it was like
Not to have a man
To raise these children on your own
Without a single plan
God I know that you were crazy
But I loved the way your raised me

Oh you're crazy
But I love the way you
Mom you're crazy
But I loved the way you raised me

You raised me
