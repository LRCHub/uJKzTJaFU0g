Tell me
Is this alright with you
Having me in your life
I always thought
That maybe I could be your wife
And I wouldn't mind living a lie
And still I keep my hopes on
I am out there
Out there lighting the dark
Your words they come so easy
Girl I just want to be me
All the sudden I'm not on your team
Replaced by the prettier things
But I see you with all these girls
I just don't understand
I guess I'm not like the rest of them
So this is my punishment, punishment, punishment
'Cause baby I'm in pain, I'm in pain, I'm in pain
I'm just trying to overcome
The fact that maybe I was not enough
The only thing that I could think of
Is whether I should give up
See you can be with any girl you like
You can send them all those fashions and socialite
Buy them all the things your money can buy
You don't owe nobody an alibi
Go ahead and leave me out of your life
No one's gonna ask you where you are tonight
You can tell your friends while you're all high
Yeah I broke her
But she'll be alright
I broke her but she'll be alright
I broke her but she'll be alright
I broke her but she'll be alright
I'm broken but I'll be alright
I'm broken but I'll be alright
I'm broken but I'll be alright
