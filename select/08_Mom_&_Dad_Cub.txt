It's hard to say the shit that you realize
When you're all alone in your mind
You know those thoughts that you just say
Fuck like damn bro I must have the worst of luck
It's okay to mess up along this road
It's filled with a stressful load
And yes I believe you because I know
What it feel like to be all alone
With nobody to turn to
Nobody to say that everything is going to be okay
I really wish I had my mom and dad those days
But they had their own problems so what could I say
They were two little kids that were trapped in their ways
I forgive you guys and it's all okay
I forgive you guys and it's all okay
Because at least for today
I have one of you to make up for all the lonely days
(Wait)

Momma really give a fuck about me

Momma really give a fuck about me
Momma really give a fuck about me
Daddy really give a fuck about me
Daddy really give a fuck about me
